# Security Assessment Report

## Package Information
- **Package**: ai-math-tutor-secure.zip
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: Tue May 27 20:46:37 EDT 2025
- **Checksum**: 050e2cc4a7064c2897e3bf54b15404c7b6b66bd0dff15b7a8e065b9ecbedfda2  dist/ai-math-tutor-secure.zip

## Security Measures Applied
✅ API key validation (no hardcoded keys)
✅ Content Security Policy headers added
✅ Minimal permissions in manifest
✅ Console.log statements removed
✅ Input validation implemented
✅ HTTPS-only API communication

## Remaining Considerations
⚠️  API keys stored in browser local storage (consider encryption)
⚠️  Content script injection (use programmatic injection)
⚠️  Rate limiting (implement client-side protection)

## Verification Steps
1. Install in fresh Chrome profile
2. Test with invalid API key (should fail gracefully)
3. Test with valid API key (should work correctly)
4. Monitor network requests (should only go to OpenAI)
5. Check extension permissions (should be minimal)

## Distribution Guidelines
- Distribute through Chrome Web Store for maximum security
- Include clear setup instructions
- Warn users about API key security
- Provide support documentation
